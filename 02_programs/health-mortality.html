<h3>Why is it relevant?</h3>
<p>Mortality rates for different age groups (infants, children, adolescents, youth and adults) and overall mortality indicators (life expectancy at birth or survival to a given age) are important indicators of health status in a country. Because data on the incidence and prevalence of diseases are frequently unavailable, mortality rates are often used to identify vulnerable populations. And they are among the indicators most frequently used to compare socioeconomic development across countries.</p>

<div id="what-is-the-methodology-1030" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>What is the methodology?</h3>
<p>The main sources of mortality data are vital registration systems and direct or indirect estimates based on sample surveys or censuses. A “complete” vital registration system - covering at least 90 percent of vital events in the population - is the best source of age-specific mortality data.</p>
<p>Estimates of neonatal, infant, and child mortality tend to vary by source and method for a given time and place. Years for available estimates also vary by country, making comparisons across countries and over time difficult. To make neonatal, infant, and child mortality estimates comparable and to ensure consistency across estimates by different agencies, the United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME), which comprises the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Bank, the United Nations Population Division, and other universities and research institutes, developed and adopted a statistical method that uses all available information to reconcile differences. The method uses statistical models to obtain a best estimate trend line by fitting a country-specific regression model of mortality rates against their reference dates.</p>

This allows calculation of the ‘population attributable fraction’ (PAF), which is the fraction of disease seen in a given population that can be attributed to the exposure (e.g in this case the annual mean concentration of particulate matter). Applying this fraction to the total burden of disease (e.g. cardiopulmonary disease expressed as deaths or DALYs), gives the total number of deaths or DALYs that results from exposure to that particular risk factor (in the example given above, to ambient air pollution). To estimate the combined effects of risk factors, a joint population attributable fraction is calculated, as described in Ezzati et al (2003).</p>

<h3>What is the indicator?</h3>
<p>Mortality rate attributed to household and ambient air pollution is the number of deaths attributable to the joint effects of household and ambient air pollution in a year per 100,000 population. The rates are age-standardized. Following diseases are taken into account: acute respiratory infections (estimated for all ages); cerebrovascular diseases in adults (estimated above 25 years); ischaemic heart diseases in adults (estimated above 25 years); chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults (estimated above 25 years); and lung cancer in adults (estimated above 25 years).</p>

<h3>Why is it relevant?</h3>
<p>Air pollution is one of the biggest environmental risks to health. According to the World Health Organization, the combined effects of ambient (outdoor) and household air pollution cause about 7 million premature deaths every year. Most deaths occur due to increased mortality from stroke, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer and acute respiratory infections. The majority of the burden is borne by populations in low and middle income countries.</p>

<p>Burden of disease (or in the present case attributable mortality) is calculated by first combining information on the increased (or relative) risk of a disease resulting from exposure, with information on how widespread the exposure is in the population (e.g. the annual mean concentration of particulate matter to which the population is exposed). This allows calculation of the ‘population attributable fraction’ (PAF), which is the fraction of disease seen in a given population that can be attributed to the exposure (e.g in this case the annual mean concentration of particulate matter).

<h3>What is the methodology?</h3>
<p>The main sources of mortality data are vital registration systems and direct or indirect estimates based on sample surveys or censuses. A “complete” vital registration system - covering at least 90 percent of vital events in the population - is the best source of age-specific mortality data. Where reliable age-specific mortality data are available, life tables can be constructed from age-specific mortality data, and adult mortality rates can be calculated from life tables.</p>

<p>Mortality rates for different age groups (infants, children, and adults) and overall mortality indicators (life expectancy at birth or survival to a given age) are important indicators of health status in a country.

<p>This indicator provides values for households and NPISHs final consumption expenditure expressed in current international dollars converted by purchasing power parity (PPP) conversion factor.</p>
<p>Household final consumption expenditure (formerly private consumption) is the market value of all goods and services, including durable products (such as cars, washing machines, and home computers), purchased by households. It excludes purchases of dwellings but includes imputed rent for owner-occupied dwellings. It also includes payments and fees to governments to obtain permits and licenses. Here, household consumption expenditure includes the expenditures of nonprofit institutions serving households, even when reported separately by the country.</p>
<p>PPP conversion factor is a spatial price deflator and currency converter that eliminates the effects of the differences in price levels between countries.</p>
<p>From July 2020, “Households and NPISHs final consumption expenditure: linked series (current LCU)” [NE.CON.PRVT.CN.AD] is used as underlying expenditure in local currency unit so that it’s in line with time series of PPP conversion factor, private consumption (LCU per international $), which are extrapolated with linked CPI.</p>

<p>Purchasing power parity (PPP) conversion factor is a spatial price deflator and currency converter that controls for price level differences between countries, thereby allowing volume comparisons of gross domestic product (GDP) and its expenditure components. This conversion factor is for GDP.</p>

<h3>Why is it relevant?</h3>
<p>PPP can be used to convert national accounts data, like GDP and its expenditure components, into a common currency, while also eliminating the effect of price level differences between countries. They can also be used to derive price level indexes (PLIs), the ratio of a country’s PPP to its market exchange rate, to directly compare price levels across countries.</p>
<p>PPPs and the PLIs and real (or PPP-adjusted) expenditures to which they give rise allow for many use-cases, but they are particularly valuable for empirical work involving comparisons of per capita consumption or levels of GDP (or other GDP aggregates) across countries and for the measurement of global poverty and global income inequality. The breadth and depth of ICP data allows its use-cases to cover other areas of economics, including empirical analyses of economic growth, productivity and trade, and even beyond, for instance, to help track global targets such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals related to health, education, energy and emissions and labor. Other applications of ICP data include their use in the construction of indexes, for example cost-of-living measures. Uses-cases can even be extended into the policymaking domain at all levels (global, regional and national) given the increased importance of cross-country benchmarking, among other possibilities.</p>
<p>Recommended uses of PPPs include: To make spatial comparisons of GDP and its expenditure components | To make spatial comparisons of price levels | To group countries by their per capita volume indexes and price level indexes</p>
<p>Recommended uses of PPPs with limitations include: To analyze changes over time in relative GDP per capita and relative prices | To analyze price convergence | To make spatial comparisons of the cost of living | To use PPPs calculated for GDP and its expenditure components as deflators for other values.</p>

<div id="what-is-the-methodology-655" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>What is the methodology?</h3>
<p>PPPs are both currency conversion factors and spatial price indexes. PPPs convert different currencies to a common currency and, in the process of conversion, equalize their purchasing power by controlling differences in price levels between countries.</p>
<p>Typically, higher income countries have higher price levels, while lower income countries have lower price levels (Balassa-Samuelson effect). Market exchange rate-based cross-country comparisons of GDP at its expenditure components reflect both differences in economic outputs (volumes) and prices. Given the differences in price levels, the size of higher income countries is inflated, while the size of lower income countries is depressed in the comparison. PPP-based cross-country comparisons of GDP at its expenditure components only reflect differences in economic outputs (volume), as PPPs control for price level differences between the countries. Hence, the comparison reflects the real size of the countries.</p>
<p>The International Comparison Program (ICP) estimates PPPs for the world’s countries. The ICP is conducted as a global partnership of countries, multilateral agencies, and academia. The most recent 2017 ICP comparison covered 176 countries, including 47 Eurostat-OECD countries. For countries that have not participated in ICP comparisons, the PPP are imputed based on a regression model.</p>
<p>ICP estimated PPPs cover years from 2011 to 2017. WDI extrapolates 2011 PPPs for years earlier years, and 2017 PPPs for later years. Description of WDI extrapolation approach is available here: <a href="https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/665452-how-do-you-extrapolate-the-ppp-conversion-factors" class="uri">https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/665452-how-do-you-extrapolate-the-ppp-conversion-factors</a></p>

<h3>What is the indicator?</h3>
<p>Price level ratio is the ratio of a purchasing power parity (PPP) conversion factor to an exchange rate. It provides a measure of the differences in price levels between countries by indicating the number of units of the common currency needed to buy the same volume of the aggregation level in each country. At the level of GDP, they provide a measure of the differences in the general price levels of countries.</p>

<h3>What is the data source?</h3>
<p>UNESCO Institute for Statistics (<a href="http://uis.unesco.org/" class="uri">http://uis.unesco.org/</a>). Data as of February 2020.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-is-the-methodology-899" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>What is the methodology?</h3>
<p>The share of expenditure on secondary education to total government expenditure on education is calculated by dividing government expenditure on secondary education by total government expenditure on education (all levels combined), and multiplying by 100. Aggregate data are based on World Bank estimates.</p>
<p>Data on education are collected by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics from official responses to its annual education survey. All the data are mapped to the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) to ensure the comparability of education programs at the international level. The current version was formally adopted by UNESCO Member States in 2011.</p>
<p>The reference years reflect the school year for which the data are presented. In some countries the school year spans two calendar years (for example, from September 2010 to June 2011); in these cases the reference year refers to the year in which the school year ended (2011 in the example).</p>

<h3>Why is it relevant?</h3>
<p>The percentage of government expenditure on education to GDP is useful to compare education expenditure between countries and/or over time in relation to the size of their economy; A high percentage to GDP suggests a high priority for education and a capacity of raising revenues for public spending. Note that government expenditure appears lower in some countries where the private sector and/or households have a large share in total funding for education.</p>

<h3>Why is it relevant?</h3>
<p>Water is considered to be the most important resource for sustaining ecosystems, which provide life-supporting services for people, animals, and plants. Global access to safe water and proper hygiene education can reduce illness and death from disease, leading to improved health, poverty reduction, and socio-economic development. However, many countries are challenged to provide these basic necessities to their populations, leaving people at risk for water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH)-related diseases. Because contaminated water is a major cause of illness and death, water quality is a determining factor in human poverty, education, and economic opportunities.</p>
<p>Lack of access to adequate drinking water services contributes to deaths and illness, especially in children. Water based disease transmission by drinking contaminated water is responsible for significant outbreaks of diseases such as cholera and typhoid and includes diarrheal diseases, viral hepatitis A, cholera, dysentery and dracunculiasis (Guineaworm disease). Improving access to clean drinking water is a crucial element in the reduction of under-five mortality and morbidity and there is evidence that ensuring higher levels of drinking water services has a greater impact.</p>
<p>Women and children spend millions of hours each year fetching water. The chore diverts their time from other important activities (for example attending school, caring for children, participating in the economy). When water is not available on premises and has to be collected, women and girls are almost two and a half times more likely than men and boys to be the main water carriers for their families.</p>
<p>Many international organizations use access to safe drinking water and hygienic sanitation facilities as a measure for progress in the fight against poverty, disease, and death. Access to safe drinking water is also considered to be a human right, not a privilege, for every man, woman, and child. Economic benefits of safe drinking water services include higher economic productivity, more education, and health-care savings.</p>

<h3>Why is it relevant?</h3>
<p>Sanitation is fundamental to human development. Many international organizations use hygienic sanitation facilities as a measure for progress in the fight against poverty, disease, and death. Access to proper sanitation is also considered to be a human right, not a privilege, for every man, woman, and child.</p>
<p>Sanitation generally refers to the provision of facilities and services for the safe disposal of human urine and feces. Inadequate sanitation is a major cause of disease world-wide and improving sanitation is known to have a significant beneficial impact on people’s health. Basic and safely managed sanitation services can reduce diarrheal disease, and can significantly lessen the adverse health impacts of other disorders responsible for death and disease among millions of children. Diarrhea and worm infections weaken children and make them more susceptible to malnutrition and opportunistic infections like pneumonia, measles and malaria.</p>
<p>The combined effects of inadequate sanitation, unsafe water supply and poor personal hygiene are responsible for many of childhood deaths. Every year, the failure to tackle these deficits results in severe welfare losses - wasted time, reduced productivity, ill health, impaired learning, environmental degradation and lost opportunities. Fundamental behavior changes are required before the use of improved facilities and services can be integrated into daily life. Many hygiene behaviors and habits are formed in childhood and, therefore, school health and hygiene education programs are an important part of water and sanitation improvements.</p>
<p>Most basic sanitation technologies are not expensive to implement. However, those facing the problems of inadequate sanitation may not be aware of either the origin of their ills, or the true costs of poor sanitation and hygiene. As a result, in most of the developing countries those without sanitation are hard to convince of the need to invest scarce resources in sanitation facilities, or of the critical importance of changing long-held habits and unhygienic behaviors. Consequently, the people’s representatives - governments and elected political leaders - rarely give sanitation or hygiene improvements the priority that is needed in order to tackle the massive sanitation deficit faced by the developing world.</p>
<p>Children bear the brunt of sanitation-related impacts - their health, nutrition, growth, education, self-respect, and life opportunities suffer as a result of inadequate sanitation. Without improved sanitation, many of the current generation of children in developing countries are unlikely to develop to their full potential. Countries that don’t take urgent action to redress sanitation deficiencies will find their future development and prosperity impaired.</p>

<p>Hygiene is closely correlated with human health.

<h3>Why is it relevant?</h3>
<p>Sanitation is fundamental to human development. Many international organizations use hygienic sanitation facilities as a measure for progress in the fight against poverty, disease, and death. Access to proper sanitation is also considered to be a human right, not a privilege, for every man, woman, and child.</p>
<p>Sanitation generally refers to the provision of facilities and services for the safe disposal of human urine and feces. Inadequate sanitation is a major cause of disease world-wide and improving sanitation is known to have a significant beneficial impact on people’s health. Basic and safely managed sanitation services can reduce diarrheal disease, and can significantly lessen the adverse health impacts of other disorders responsible for death and disease among millions of children. Diarrhea and worm infections weaken children and make them more susceptible to malnutrition and opportunistic infections like pneumonia, measles and malaria.</p>
<p>The combined effects of inadequate sanitation, unsafe water supply and poor personal hygiene are responsible for many of childhood deaths. Every year, the failure to tackle these deficits results in severe welfare losses - wasted time, reduced productivity, ill health, impaired learning, environmental degradation and lost opportunities. Fundamental behavior changes are required before the use of improved facilities and services can be integrated into daily life. Many hygiene behaviors and habits are formed in childhood and, therefore, school health and hygiene education programs are an important part of water and sanitation improvements.</p>
<p>Most basic sanitation technologies are not expensive to implement. However, those facing the problems of inadequate sanitation may not be aware of either the origin of their ills, or the true costs of poor sanitation and hygiene. As a result, in most of the developing countries those without sanitation are hard to convince of the need to invest scarce resources in sanitation facilities, or of the critical importance of changing long-held habits and unhygienic behaviors. Consequently, the people’s representatives - governments and elected political leaders - rarely give sanitation or hygiene improvements the priority that is needed in order to tackle the massive sanitation deficit faced by the developing world.</p>
<p>Children bear the brunt of sanitation-related impacts - their health, nutrition, growth, education, self-respect, and life opportunities suffer as a result of inadequate sanitation. Without improved sanitation, many of the current generation of children in developing countries are unlikely to develop to their full potential. Countries that don’t take urgent action to redress sanitation deficiencies will find their future development and prosperity impaired.</p>

<h3>What is the indicator?</h3>
<p>Tuberculosis treatment success rate is the percentage of all new tuberculosis cases (or new and relapse cases for some countries) registered under a national tuberculosis control programme in a given year that successfully completed treatment, with or without bacteriological evidence of success (“cured” and “treatment completed” respectively).</p>

<h3>What is the methodology?</h3>
<p>Tuberculosis is one of the main causes of adult deaths from a single infectious agent in developing countries. Data on the success rate of tuberculosis treatment are provided for countries that have submitted data to the WHO. The treatment success rate for tuberculosis provides a useful indicator of the quality of health services. A low rate suggests that infectious patients may not be receiving adequate treatment. An important complement to the tuberculosis treatment success rate is the case detection rate, which indicates whether there is adequate coverage by the recommended case detection and treatment strategy.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">66.27</span> Tuberculosis case detection rate (%, all forms)</h2>
<div id="what-is-the-indicator-1022" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>What is the indicator?</h3>
<p>Tuberculosis case detection rate (all forms) is the number of new and relapse tuberculosis cases notified to WHO in a given year, divided by WHO’s estimate of the number of incident tuberculosis cases for the same year, expressed as a percentage. Estimates for all years are recalculated as new information becomes available and techniques are refined, so they may differ from those published previously.</p>

<h3>What is the methodology?</h3>
<p>Tuberculosis is one of the main causes of adult deaths from a single infectious agent in developing countries. This indicator shows the tuberculosis detection rate for all detection methods. Editions before 2010 included the tuberculosis detection rates by DOTS, the internationally recommended strategy for tuberculosis control. Thus data on the case detection rate from 2010 onward cannot be compared with data in previous editions.</p>

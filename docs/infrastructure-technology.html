<h3>What is the methodology?</h3>
<p>The gross domestic expenditure on R&amp;D indicator consists of the total expenditure (current and capital) on R&amp;D by all resident companies, research institutes, university and government laboratories, etc. It excludes R&amp;D expenditures financed by domestic firms but performed abroad.</p>
<p>The OECD’s Frascati Manual defines research and experimental development as “creative work undertaken on a systemic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of man, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications.” R&amp;D covers basic research, applied research, and experimental development.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Basic research - Basic research is experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the underlying foundation of phenomena and observable facts, without any particular application or use in view</p></li>
<li><p>Applied research - Applied research is also original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge; it is, however, directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or objective.</p></li>
<li><p>Experimental development - Experimental development is systematic work, drawing on existing knowledge gained from research and/or practical experience, which is directed to producing new materials, products or devices, to installing new processes, systems and services, or to improving substantially those already produced or installed.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The fields of science and technology used to classify R&amp;D according to the Revised Fields of Science and Technology Classification are:
1. Natural sciences;
2. Engineering and technology;
3. Medical and health sciences;
4. Agricultural sciences;
5. Social sciences;
6. Humanities and the arts.</p>
<p>The data are obtained through statistical surveys which are regularly conducted at national level covering R&amp;D performing entities in the private and public sectors.</p>

<p>Estimates of the resources allocated to R&amp;D are affected by national characteristics such as the periodicity and coverage of national R&amp;D surveys across institutional sectors and industries; and the use of different sampling and estimation methods. R&amp;D typically involves a few large performers, hence R&amp;D surveys use various techniques to maintain up-to-date registers of known performers, while attempting to identify new or occasional performers.</p>
<p>R&amp;D totals from SNA accounts may differ from these estimates, due in part to the different treatments of software R&amp;D in the totals.</p>

<p>Industrial design applications are applications to register an industrial design with a national or regional Intellectual Property (IP) offices and designations received by relevant offices through the Hague System. Industrial designs are applied to a wide variety of industrial products and handicrafts. They refer to the ornamental or aesthetic aspects of a useful article, including compositions of lines or colors or any three-dimensional forms that give a special appearance to a product or handicraft. The holder of a registered industrial design has exclusive rights against unauthorized copying or imitation of the design by third parties. Industrial design registrations are valid for a limited period. The term of protection is usually 15 years for most jurisdictions. However, differences in legislation do exist, notably in China (which provides for a 10-year term from the application date). Non-resident application refers to an application filed with the IP office of or acting on behalf of a state or jurisdiction in which the first-named applicant in the application is not domiciled. Design count is used to render application data for industrial applications across offices comparable, as some offices follow a single-class/single-design filing system while other have a multiple class/design filing system.</p>

<p>A scientific journal is a periodical publication intended to further the progress of science, usually by reporting new research. Most journals are highly specialized, although some of the oldest journals such as Nature publish articles and scientific papers across a wide range of scientific fields. Scientific journals contain articles that have been peer reviewed. When a scientific journal describes experiments or calculations, they must supply enough details that an independent researcher could repeat the experiment or calculation to verify the results. Each such journal article becomes part of the permanent scientific record.</p>
<p>Some journals, such as Nature, Science, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS), and Physical Review Letters, have a reputation of publishing articles that mark a fundamental breakthrough in their respective fields.</p>

Articles are classified by year of publication and assigned to region/country/economy on basis of institutional address(es) listed on the article. Articles are counted on a fractional-count basis that is, for articles with collaborating institutions from multiple countries/economies, each country/economy receives fractional credit on basis of proportion of its participating institutions.

<p>Patent applications are worldwide patent applications filed through the Patent Cooperation Treaty procedure or with a national patent office for exclusive rights for an invention–a product or process that provides a new way of doing something or offers a new technical solution to a problem.

<h3>Why is it relevant?</h3>
<p>The Patent Cooperation Treaty (www.wipo.int/pct) provides a two phase system for filing patent. International applications under the treaty provide for a national patent grant only - there is no international patent. The national filing represents the applicant’s seeking of patent protection for a given territory, whereas international filings, while representing a legal right, do not accurately reflect where patent protection is sought. Resident filings are those from residents of the country concerned. Nonresident filings are from applicants abroad. For regional offices applications from residents of any member state of the regional patent convention are considered nonresident filings. Some offices (notably the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office) use the residence of the inventor rather than the applicant to classify filings.</p>
<p>Patent data are a great resource for the study of technical change in a country or region. Patent data provide a uniquely detailed source of information on inventive activity and the multiple dimensions of the inventive process (e.g. geographical location, technical and institutional origin, individuals and networks). Furthermore, patent data form a consistent basis for comparisons across time and across countries.</p>
<p>Patent data can be used in the analysis of a wide array of topics related to technical change and patenting activity including industry-science linkages, patenting strategies by companies, internationalization of research, and indicators on the value of patents. Patent-based statistics reflect the inventive performance of countries, regions and firms, as well as other aspects of the dynamics of the innovation process such as co-operation in innovation or technology paths.</p>

A trademark is a distinctive sign which identifies certain goods or services as those produced or provided by a specific person or enterprise. A trademark provides protection to the owner of the mark by ensuring the exclusive right to use it to identify goods or services, or to authorize another to use it in return for payment. The period of protection varies, but a trademark can be renewed indefinitely beyond the time limit on payment of additional fees. Resident application refers to an application filed with the IP office of or acting on behalf of the state or jurisdiction in which the first-named applicant in the application has residence. Class count is used to render application data for trademark applications across offices comparable, as some offices follow a single-class/single-design filing system while other have a multiple class/design filing system.</p>

<h3>Why is it relevant?</h3>
<p>A trademark is a distinctive sign that identifies certain goods or services as those produced or provided by a specific person or enterprise. The holder of a registered trademark has the legal right to exclusive use of the mark in relation to the products or services for which it is registered. The owner can prevent unauthorized use of the trademark, or a confusingly similar mark, so as to prevent consumers and the public in general from being misled. Unlike patents, trademarks can be maintained indefinitely by paying renewal fees.</p>
<p>The procedures for registering trademarks are governed by the rules and regulations of national and regional IP offices. Trademark rights are limited to the jurisdiction of the authority that registers the trademark. Trademarks can be registered by filing an application at the relevant national or regional office(s), or by filing an international application through the Madrid system.</p>
<p>Many offices in middle- and low-income economies have considerably high numbers of trademark applications compared to other forms of IP, showing the emphasis placed on trademark rights in these markets.</p>

<p>Because industrial sectors specializing in a few high-technology products may also produce low-technology products, the product approach is more appropriate for international trade. The method takes only R&amp;D intensity into account, but other characteristics of high technology are also important, such as knowhow, scientific personnel, and technology embodied in patents. Considering these characteristics would yield a different list (see Hatzichronoglou 1997). The indicator is based on data reported by countries to COMTRADE. The export values presented in the World Development Indicators represent Gross Exports less Re-Exports. The values may be impacted in cases of reporting errors or missing data, for example if countries do not report Re-Exports for one or more periods.</p>
